        <h2>Violet the Smash Player</h2>
        <p>
            Hailing from Northeast Ohio, Rosa "Violet" Kilmer is a Joker and Sonic comain who's been in the offline Smash Ultimate scene since
            2021. She can be regularly seen at Kent Combo tournaments. She's also a part of the Spinda's Cafe online Smash crew where she's been a member for the entire lifetime
            of the crew. She has an offline win rate of 30% for sets and a 35% win rate for individual games. While having no notable placements in majors or regionals, she still likes
            to attend tournaments each week in the hopes of having fun and getting better and growing as a player.
        </p>
        <h2>Rosa at Home</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of Smash, Rosa is currently a senior Computer Science student at Kent State University. She's been studying to become a game programmer or even a software engineer.
            At 22 years old, she's worked at the Kent State University Service and Repair Center as a computer repair technician since 2020. Her interest in technology and computers
            motivates her to keep learning and growing as a programmer. In her free time, she enjoys playing other video games, especially Sonic games and Persona. Currently, she is working
            on finishing Persona 3 Reload, the Emblems in Sonic Adventure DX, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. 
        </p>
        <h2>Rosa the Elusive</h2>
        <p>
            She hosts a YouTube channel where she showcases her Smash VODs and other miscellaneous gameplay from streams she's done. But there's also a lot of cringeworthy stuff on
            there so good luck finding it. She's also on other social medias. But again. Good luck finding them.
        </p>
        <h2>Rosa's Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            Rosa really hopes one day to be able to develop the video game of her dreams. Other than that, she'd like to be a better Smash player, start her medical transition, meet
            her multiple online friends, and travel across the world to play in different tournaments and meet interesting people. She also hopes to be able to pick up a job in the field
            she has been studying in for the last 4 years and eventually be able to move out and live on her own.
